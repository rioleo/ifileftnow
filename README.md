# If I Left Now

**If I Left Now** is a web app that displays commute times from home and work using the Google Maps API. It lets you repurpose old smartphones as dedicated displays for your commute.

## Features

* All information is stored locally on the device.
* Customized time ranges for minute-by-minute traffic ETA.
* Background themes pulled from SnazzyMaps.com, set the zoom levels.
* 24 or 12-hour time format

## Requirements

* A Google Maps API key. You can get a API key by following the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/). You should also enable the DistanceMatrix API. ** Do note that live traffic estimates are planned for general release in the first half of 2016. If you cannot wait until then sign up for the [Premium plan](https://developers.google.com/maps/pricing-and-plans/) **

* A web-enabled smartphone. Any size will do, although the video above uses a Nexus 4. It's convenient if you use an Android because then you can force the device to always be in landscape mode, and you can also prevent the device from falling asleep as long as it's plugged in. Finally, an Android device will always wake up when you plug it in, meaning you don't actually need physical access to the power button.
